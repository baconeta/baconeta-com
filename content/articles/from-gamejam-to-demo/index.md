## How it all started

Back in 2023, Ludum Dare 54 gave us the theme **Limited Space**, and we dove in headfirst. The result was a tiny prototype of *Setting the Stage*, a musical puzzle game that squeezed a lot of ideas into a small jam-sized package.

After the jam, we showed it around to a few industry folks, mostly just friends and contacts at work. The reactions were encouraging - people genuinely liked the concept and suggested we should expand it into a full game. That was exciting, but also… kind of intimidating.

## Taking a break (and why)

Once the initial hype settled, we hit a rough patch. Motivation dropped, life got busy, and development paused for almost a year in total. It’s easy to underestimate how draining it can be to push a prototype into a full game, especially while juggling other projects and jobs. Looking back, that break was probably necessary — it gave us time to step away from the game and actually come back later with fresh eyes.

## Picking it back up

When we returned to *Setting the Stage*, we focused on building it properly. That meant redesigning the experience a little, improving visuals, and figuring out how to keep it engaging for longer. Progress was slower but steady, and we started to feel the momentum again.

### Development Timeline

- **October 2023 – Ludum Dare 54**
    - Theme: *Limited Space*
    - Created the initial *Setting the Stage* prototype during the 48-hour jam.
    - Focus: musical puzzle mechanics, small levels, quick gameplay loop.
    - *(Image placeholder: jam build screenshot)*


- **November 2023 – Early feedback**
    - Showed the prototype to industry friends and contacts.
    - Feedback: concept has potential for a full game, mechanics are fun but rough.


- **December 2023 – LD Results**
    - We placed 3rd in the audio category and very highly in all other categories.
    - This gave us the inspiration we needed to put everything into place for a full game


- **January 2024 – Getting started**
    - Started the project with fresh ideas.
    - Expanded mechanics, started redesigning levels, refining visuals.
    - Focused on creating a playable experience beyond the jam prototype.
    - *(Image placeholder: early full game mockup)*


- **February 2024 – Motivation drop & pause**
    - Development halted due to burnout and other commitments.
    - Took many months off, accidentally


- **Mid 2024 – Restarting development**
    - Motivated by a deadline to submit the game for a competition, we got back to business.
    - We rushed and went in way over our heads and so didn't have the success we wanted to deliver and achieve there.


- **After the NZGDC 2024 – A second, but much longer break**
    - Not much to say here, we had over 7 months away, mentally and physically.


- **July 2025 – Back to business and putting together our beta build**
    - Offered a spot to showcase the game at NZGDC in September, we got back into overdrive mode
    - Came back and managed to get remotivated and driven to complete the rest of the work by NZGDC 2025
    - First beta demo completed, internal and external testing.
    - Added small narrative touches, and visual polish.


- **September 2025 – Demo launch**
    - Public demo goes live.
    - Players can try the core mechanics and get a feel for the full game.
