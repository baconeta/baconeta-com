A passionate and highly educated computer scientist focusing on video game production.

I live in and come from New Zealand but have lived and worked abroad in UK, Germany and Finland with my wife and daughter.

I have a management and leadership background with a high level of experience in multi-departmental collaboration.

My recent professional experience is part of the Angry Birds mobile games in Rovio as a Games Programmer where I also explored and seconded into our live game production pipelines.

Experienced in leading remote team game projects, including game jams and UE4/Unity prototypes.
