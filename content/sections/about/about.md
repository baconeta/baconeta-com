I’m a passionate computer scientist and game producer with a strong background in collaboration and leading multi-department projects.

Originally from New Zealand, I’ve also lived and worked in the UK, Germany, and Finland with my wife and daughter.

I currently work as a game producer at Void Interactive on the Steam hit Ready or Not. Before that, I was a Game Programmer on Rovio’s Angry Birds mobile team, where I also got involved in live game production pipelines.

Outside of work, I run my own hobby studio, Baconeta Studios, and we’ve just launched the beta demo for our first game, Setting the Stage. I also enjoy leading remote teams on game jams and developing prototypes in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity.
