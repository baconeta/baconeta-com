A passionate and highly educated computer scientist focusing on video game programming and production.

I come from New Zealand but live in Vantaa, Finland, with my fianc√©, daughter, and our cat, Pixel.

I have a management and leadership background with a high competence in multi-departmental collaboration.

My recent experience is in game programming at an advanced level, and exploring the connection between the various game development fields.

Experienced in leading remote team game projects, including game jams and UE4/Unity prototypes.
