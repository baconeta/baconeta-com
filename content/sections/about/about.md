A passionate and highly educated computer scientist focusing on video game production.

I live in and come from New Zealand but have lived and worked abroad in UK, Germany and Finland with my wife and daughter.

I have a management and leadership background with a high level of experience in multi-departmental collaboration.

I currently work as a game producer for the company Void Interactive working on the steam hit [Ready or Not](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/). 
Prior to that, I was part of the Angry Birds mobile team in Rovio as a Game Programmer where I also explored and seconded into our live game production pipelines.

Experienced in leading remote team game projects, including game jams and UE4/Unity prototypes.
