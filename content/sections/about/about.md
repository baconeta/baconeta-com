A passionate and highly educated computer scientist focusing on video game programming and production.

I come from New Zealand but currently live in Vantaa, Finland, with my fianc√©, daughter, and our cat, Pixel.

I have a management and leadership background with a high competence in multi-departmental collaboration.

My recent professional experience is part of the Angry Birds mobile games in Rovio as a Games Programmer where I am also exploring cross-role communication and live game production pipelines.

Experienced in leading remote team game projects, including game jams and UE4/Unity prototypes.
